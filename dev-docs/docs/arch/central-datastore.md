# Central datastore

The DT platform contains a number of shared data-storage services defined in the `data-store` directory.

**TODO:**

- Syncing the master password across all database engines
- Ability to reset database passwords for a DT/independent service (need to keep record of all databases associated with each DT)
- Access control and database ownership for each DT/independent service
